Indicates possible issues in cost control or discount strategy during certain periods.

Regional Profit Growth

Some regions, such as Africa, started with low profit margins but showed steady improvement in later years.

This may reflect growing market potential and better regional strategies.

suggesting stable pricing and high demand.
